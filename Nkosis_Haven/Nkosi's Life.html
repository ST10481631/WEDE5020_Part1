  <!-- Early Life -->
<main>
<h2> Nkosi’s Early Life</h2>
  <p>Nkosi Johnson, born on the 4th of February 1989 was born with HIV.
  His mother Nonthlanthla Nkosi was someone  who had HIV and when Nkosi was 8, she passed away .
  She was not able to take care of him because of her health so she had no choice but to ask Gail Johnson who was a volunteer at an AIDS care center to take care of Nkosi.
  He was adopted by Gil legally and his name was changed to Nkosi Johnson.

  <!-- Advocacy -->
<h2>His Past Expirence</h2>
  <p>
  When Nkosi was 8, he expirenced discrimination when a primary school did'nt want to admit him because he had HIV. After that schools had to accept children with HIV/AIDS after a ruling made in court
  At the age of 8, Nkosi faced discrimination when a primary school refused to admit him due to his HIV status. A court ruling later mandated that schools accept HIV-positive children, challenging widespread stigma.
  He stressed in a speech he said when he was 11 at the 13th International AIDS Conference that people need to accept children living with HIV/AIDS and also adding that:
  </p>
 
  <p><em>“We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else—don’t be afraid of us—we are all the same!”</em>(Nkosi Johnson, 2000)</p>

<!-- Nkosi's Haven -->
<h2>Nkosi’s Haven</h2>
  <p> Nkosi and Gail founded Nkosi’s Haven because Gail was inspired by the challenges that Nkosi faced and his past experiences. 
  The organisation stays true to Nkosi's goal of a world that does not discriminate or fear families affected by HIV/AIDS.
  Nkosi has left behind an impact globally even though his life was cut short. He was able to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS while going against discrimination
  which led to organisations like Nkosi’s Haven and others to be inspired
