    <h2>Nkosi’s Early Life</h2>
    <p>Nkosi Johnson, born on the 4th of February 1989 was born with HIV.
    His mother Nonthlanthla Nkosi had HIV and passed away when Nkosi was 8.  
    He was adopted by Gail Johnson who legally changed his name to Nkosi Johnson.</p>

    <h2>His Past Experience</h2>
    <p>When Nkosi was 8, he experienced discrimination when a primary school refused to admit him because he had HIV.  
    After a court ruling, schools had to accept children with HIV/AIDS.  
    He stressed in a speech at the 13th International AIDS Conference that people need to accept children living with HIV/AIDS, adding:</p>
    <p class="quote"><em>“We are normal. We have hands. We have feet. We can walk, we can talk, we have needs just like everyone else—don’t be afraid of us—we are all the same!”</em> (Nkosi Johnson, 2000)</p>

    <h2>Nkosi’s Haven</h2>
    <p>Nkosi and Gail founded Nkosi’s Haven inspired by his past experiences.  
    The organisation stays true to Nkosi's goal of a world that does not discriminate against families affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
