Their main focus of the organisation activities is the Nkosi's Haven Village located in Johannesburg, Alan Manor which was created in 2002.

<p align="right">
In 2008, Nkosi’s Haven created Nkosi’s 4Life Farm in Johannesburg to add onto their vision of sustainability.
 It was made so that the Village would be able to get food supply and the women could go work on the farms and if there are extra crops, they could sell the extra crops to genereate income for themselves.
This teaches the women how to become independent and learn how to work for themselves.
</p>
<ul type="none" align="right">
<u>These are the objectives of the Nkosi's Haven 4Life Farm:</u>
<li>Crops feed the residents and other communities around</li>
<li>Receive profit by seeling some of the produce</li>
<li>Help people in need affected by HIV/AIDS</li>
</ul>
