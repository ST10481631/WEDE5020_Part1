<!-- Introduction to Nkosi's Haven-->
 <main>
   
        <p> Nkosi's Haven is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that is based in Johannesburg which was created in 1999 to provide complete medical services to mothers and children affected by HIV & AIDS.  
         The NGO also provides support for orphans, regardless of whether they are affected by HIV/AIDS or not.
         Compared to traditional orphanages, Nkosi's Haven works to keep mothers and children together recognizing that family unity is essential for healing and freedom. 
         It is named after Nkosi Johnson, a young activist who was courageous and advocated for the rights of children living with HIV. 
         The organisation's mission was inspired by the legacy of Nkosi Johnson.</p>
