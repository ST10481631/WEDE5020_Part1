    Nkosi's Haven is a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Johannesburg, created in 1999 to provide complete medical services to mothers and children affected by HIV & AIDS.  
    The NGO also provides support for orphans, regardless of whether they are affected by HIV/AIDS or not.  
    Compared to traditional orphanages, Nkosi's Haven works to keep mothers and children together, recognizing that family unity is essential for healing and freedom.  
    It is named after Nkosi Johnson, a young activist who was courageous and advocated for the rights of children living with HIV.  
    The organisation's mission was inspired by the legacy of Nkosi Johnson.

  <h2>Their Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Their mission statement states that they make sure that everyone who lives there is taught how to live life with HIV/AIDS and not die from it, through all of the things they do for their residents.  
    The nonprofit organization fights the stigma of HIV by providing a safe and caring environment whereby families can live together while getting medical, educational and psychosocial care.  
    Nkosi’s Haven aims to create a homely environment where the people there can live freely without facing any stereotype or discrimination.  
    They offer residential care, education, therapy, and life skills training, etc.
